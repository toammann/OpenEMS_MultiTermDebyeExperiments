function posSkipped = skipFixedMeshLine(pos, minDist, verbose)
% SKIPFIXEDMESHLINE - Removes meshlines adjacent distances less than minDist
%
%   Meshlines defined in "pos" are considered as fixed meshlines. These are 
%   manually defined lines in an openEMS simulation script. Horn_Antenna
%   
%   If this meshlines are located very close to each other this will result in a
%   small cell size (small timesteps) which will lead to long simulation times.
%   
%   If the user is about to tune the model the problematic meshlines will most 
%   likely occur at diffrent places in the model. This is an automatic approach
%   to resolve this issues.
%
%   As a user, define fixed meshlines at all places of interest. This function 
%   will remove meshlines below a threshold defined by "minDist". It is assumed 
%   that meshlines with a lower index (which appear first in the pos array) have 
%   a higher priority. Therefore the lower index meshlines will be kept and the 
%   higher index lines will be discarded.
%
%   Make sure to place the most importent meshlines at the begging of the "pos" 
%   array.
%   Input:
%     pos       [double[] ]  - Array containig mesh line positions sorted by
%                              priority. (first in array --> highest priority)
%
%     delim     [minDist]    - Minimum distance between meshlines
%
%   Output:
%    posSkipped [double[] ]  - Array with mesh line distances > minDist
